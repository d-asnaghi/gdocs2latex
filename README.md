# gdocs2latex
A latex conversion add-on for google docs based on the [gdocs2md](https://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md) by Renato Mangini.

This converter can be used to process a gdocs page and produces output LaTeX that can be copied and pasted into any TeX editor.

## Installation
- On the toolbar click `Tools`
- Click `<Script Editor>`
- Create a `.gs` file
- Copy and paste the contents of `code.gs`
- Create a `.html` file
- Copy and paste the contents of `sidebar.gs`

## Use
In your document under 'Add Ons' you should now see the converter, click to start the application and use the web GUI to copy and paste your LaTeX code. 

## Experimental features
The 'Small Caps' feature is experimental and converts text to small caps by capitalizing all the selected text and reducing the font size of originally non capitalized letters.
